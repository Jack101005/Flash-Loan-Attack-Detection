## Current project state (update this section as work progresses)

### Stage 1 — Ingestion ✅ COMPLETE
- `ingestion/listener.py` — WebSocket listener, two-pass filter (contract
  address → function selector), ABI decoding, auto-reconnect with
  exponential backoff (max 5 retries, doubling delay starting at 1 s),
  in-memory dedup set (cap 10 000 hashes), Kafka produce with fallback
  log, `--no-kafka` flag for offline mode, session stats summary.
  **RPC failover:** accepts a list of WebSocket URLs (`ETH_WSS_PRIMARY` +
  `ETH_WSS_FALLBACK` from `.env`). Rotates to the next URL only when a
  session fails before receiving any transactions (unhealthy provider
  signal). A session that received ≥1 tx keeps its URL on retry.
  Override via `--url` / `--fallback-url` CLI flags.
- `ingestion/listener_mp.py` — 🆕 Multi-process variant of `listener.py`
  for ingestion throughput scaling. **Status: structurally validated
  end-to-end on the offline CSV path; not yet load-tested against real
  RPC latency (live mode).** See `ingestion/LISTENER_MP_NOTES.md` for full
  design rationale, the two race conditions found and fixed during
  validation, and benchmark results. Quick summary:
  - **Architecture:** one feeder process holds the single mempool
    subscription (live mode) or reads the CSV (offline mode) and fans
    items out via a `multiprocessing.Queue` to N worker processes. Each
    worker owns its own Web3 connection + Kafka producer (created
    post-fork — neither is picklable). One subscription/reader, many
    fetchers — duplicating the subscription would make every worker
    re-fetch every item.
  - **`--offline` mode:** replays `data/test_data_enriched.csv` directly —
    no WebSocket, no mock server, no Docker, no network at all. Add
    `--no-kafka` to also skip `confluent_kafka` entirely (zero deps).
  - **`--offline --benchmark`:** sweeps workers=1/2/4/8 over the CSV and
    prints a speedup table.
  - Fixed during validation: (1) `--no-kafka` previously still imported
    `confluent_kafka` transitively via an unconditional module-level
    import — now nested inside `if use_kafka:`; (2) shared
    `Manager().dict()["x"] += 1` counters lost 35–55% of increments
    under 4-way contention (non-atomic read-RPC + increment + write-RPC
    across process boundaries) — replaced with per-worker local counters,
    written once each to a shared results map and summed by the parent;
    (3) added a `Barrier(n_workers + 1)` so a zero-delay feeder cannot
    drain the queue before slow-starting workers are ready.
  - **Validated result (60-row CSV, 4 workers, `--no-kafka`):**
    `detected=35`, `filtered_out=25`, `detected + filtered_out == rows`,
    `sum(worker_loads) == rows`, 4 distinct PIDs. Counts are now exact
    and reproducible across runs (work *distribution* across workers
    still varies run-to-run due to OS scheduling — that's expected).
  - **Benchmark findings (offline, no per-item delay):**
    - **60-row CSV (test_data_enriched.csv):** speedup is *negative*
      — 1 worker fastest (0.407 s), 8 workers ~16% slower (0.483 s).
      `mp.Process` spawn cost dominates a sub-millisecond-per-row
      workload. This is the same phenomenon as "Spark 1 worker slower
      than single-process" one layer up.
    - **865-row CSV (test_data_large.csv, 429 detected / 436 filtered):**
      speedup turns *positive* — workers=2 gives 2.39× (0.282 s,
      1519 det/s), workers=4 gives 2.26× (0.298 s). Gains taper past
      2 workers as per-worker share shrinks. This is Amdahl
      amortization: the same spawn overhead, amortized over ~14× more
      work, becomes negligible. The positive-speedup case for real RPC
      latency (`--rpc-delay` in live mode) has not yet been run.
- `ingestion/mock_server.py` — JSON-RPC 2.0 mock Ethereum node; serves
  `eth_subscribe`, `eth_getTransactionByHash`, `eth_getBlockByNumber`
  over WebSocket. Supports `--delay`, `--loop`, `--data` flags.
- `ingestion/config.py` — `WATCHLIST` (3 contracts) + `SELECTORS`
  (4 selectors). See Key Constants below.
- `data/test_data_enriched.csv` — enriched dataset, **60 rows total**
  (corrected from the previously-documented 35 — see Known Issues #8).
  Of the 60: **35 rows match a watched contract + selector** (`detected` —
  these are the "35 flash loan transactions" referenced elsewhere in the
  docs/benchmarks), **25 rows are filtered out** (general Aave selectors
  not in `SELECTORS` such as `supply`/`withdraw`/`borrow`/`repay`, one
  empty-`input` Uniswap row, and one Uniswap row whose `input` is an
  ASCII phishing-link payload). Includes `block_timestamp` used by mock
  server for historical price lookups.
- `abis/aave_v3_pool.json` — Aave V3 Pool ABI (flashLoan + flashLoanSimple)
- `abis/balancer_v2_vault.json` — Balancer V2 Vault ABI (flashLoan)
- `abis/uniswap_v3_pool.json` — Uniswap V3 Pool ABI (flash)

### Stage 2 — Kafka ✅ COMPLETE
- 3-broker cluster (`kafka-1`, `kafka-2`, `kafka-3`) in Docker.
  Topic `raw_txns`: 4 partitions, replication factor 3, 1-hour retention.
  Partition default set via `KAFKA_NUM_PARTITIONS: 4` to prevent race-
  condition auto-create at 1 partition.
- `broker/kafka_producer.py` — `create_producer()`, `produce_message()`,
  `flush_producer()`, `ensure_topic()`. Bootstrap: 3 brokers,
  `acks="all"`, `replication_factor=3`.
  **Idempotent producer:** `enable.idempotence=True`, `retries=2147483647`,
  `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection=5`. Broker deduplicates retried
  produces by (PID, partition, seq) — prevents duplicate messages in
  `raw_txns` on network blips or broker leader elections.
- `broker/kafka_consumer.py` — `create_consumer()`, `consume_messages()`
  iterator, `start_consumer_loop()` for lightweight non-Spark consumers.
  Manual offset commit for exactly-once semantics.
- `broker/consumer_groups.py` — group registry (`flash_loan_detectors`,
  `alerting_group`, `debug_consumer`), `describe_group_lag()`,
  `reset_group_to_earliest()`.
- **Note:** `alerting_group` exists in code but no Telegram service was
  implemented. Telegram was scoped out of the final build.

### Stage 3 — PySpark Streaming ✅ COMPLETE
- `processing/streaming_job.py` — PySpark Structured Streaming job
  submitted via `spark-submit` to `spark://spark-master:7077`.
- **Detection method:** selector match + USD notional threshold scoring.
  There is no graph construction, no DFS, no cycle detection. The original
  spec's NetworkX approach was replaced entirely.
- Pipeline inside the job:
  1. `readStream` from Kafka topic `raw_txns` (earliest offsets)
  2. Parse JSON → extract `selector` (first 10 chars of `input`)
  3. Filter rows where `selector` ∈ PROTOCOL_BY_SELECTOR
  4. `decode_flash_loan_udf` — raw calldata → `assets[]` + `amounts[]`
  5. `symbol_udf` — token address → symbol (USDC, USDT, WETH, WBTC, USDe, DAI)
  6. `human_amount_udf` — raw uint256 → human-readable float (decimals-aware)
  7. `price_udf` — Redis hist cache → CoinGecko history API → static fallback.
     Key pattern: `hist_price:{SYMBOL}:{DD-MM-YYYY}`. TTL: 86 400 s.
     **Limitation:** CoinGecko returns daily average, not spot price at tx time.
  8. `confidence_udf` — thresholds: HIGH ≥ $1 M, MEDIUM ≥ $100 K, else LOW
  9. `write_to_mongo` via `foreachBatch → foreachPartition` — distributed
     bulk upsert to MongoDB Atlas (no driver-side collect).
- Trigger: console sink every 5 s, MongoDB sink every 10 s.
- Checkpoint: `/tmp/spark-checkpoints/flash-loan-detection` (Docker volume).
- **Known limitation:** Uniswap V3 flash() decode produces literal strings
  `"token0"` / `"token1"` as asset labels (not real addresses), so symbol
  lookup returns `UNKNOWN`, price = 0, and confidence = LOW for all
  Uniswap flash loans. This is a stub — not yet fixed.

### Stage 4 — Storage & State ✅ COMPLETE
- `storage/mongo_store.py` — singleton `MongoClient`, `init_indexes()`,
  `transactions_collection()`, `get_recent_detections()`, `save_detection()`.
  MongoDB Atlas via TLS + certifi.
- **Collection name:** `transactions` (inside DB `flash_loan_detection`).
- **⚠️ Known ordering issue:** `get_recent_detections()` sorts by
  `detected_at DESCENDING`, but the Spark writer (`_write_partition_to_mongo`)
  never writes `detected_at` — it writes `processed_at` (Unix int). The
  `detected_at` field is only written by `save_detection()`, which is not
  called by Spark. Dashboard ordering may therefore be non-deterministic.
  Fix: change sort field to `processed_at` or `timestamp` in `mongo_store.py`.
- Redis is used by the Spark job for historical price caching only.
  There is no separate price-feed service (it was removed).
  Redis is authenticated (`REDIS_PASS` env var required).

### Stage 5 — Backend API ✅ COMPLETE
- `backend/Main.py` — FastAPI app. Endpoints:
  - `GET  /`                  — liveness check
  - `GET  /health/db`         — MongoDB ping
  - `POST /decode`            — look up a tx hash in MongoDB, return
                                structured `DecodeResponse`
  - `GET  /stream/detections` — SSE endpoint; async generator polls
                                MongoDB every 1 s; sends `event: detections`
                                when fingerprint changes, `: heartbeat` otherwise.
- CORS: all origins allowed (`allow_origins=["*"]`).
- `init_indexes()` called on startup.
- Run: `uvicorn backend.Main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload`
  or inside `backend/`: `uv run uvicorn Main:app --reload --port 8000`
- **Note:** `cycle_path` is returned in both `/decode` and `/stream/detections`
  but is always `[]` — the Spark job never computes a cycle path.

### Stage 6 — Frontend Dashboard ✅ COMPLETE
- `frontend/` — React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.
- `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` — connects to SSE `/stream/detections`;
  renders KPI cards + live detections table + ReactFlow topology panel.
- `src/pages/DecodePage.tsx` — manual tx hash lookup via `POST /decode`.
- `src/components/dashboard/KpiCards.tsx` — 4 cards: Active Alerts,
  High Confidence, Medium Confidence, Max Borrowed.
- `src/components/dashboard/LiveDetectionsTable.tsx` — scrollable table,
  click-to-select a transaction.
- `src/components/dashboard/TransactionGraph.tsx` — ReactFlow panel;
  renders a simple 2-node graph (Sender → Pool) for the selected tx.
  **Note:** this is a cosmetic topology view, not a cycle graph. `cycle_path`
  is not used here.
- `src/hooks/useDecoder.ts` + `src/services/decoderService.ts` — decode page logic.
- Run: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev`
- API URL hardcoded as `http://localhost:8000` in `HomePage.tsx`.
  `decoderService.ts` reads `VITE_API_URL` env var with same fallback.

### Benchmarks & Fault Tolerance Demo ✅ COMPLETE
- `benchmarks/single_process_job.py` — Baseline pipeline: same decode/enrich/
  score/write logic as `streaming_job.py` but one Python process, no Spark,
  reads CSV directly. Supports `--crash-after N` to simulate a mid-batch crash
  (pending docs lost, no checkpoint). Writes to `transactions_benchmark` collection.
- `benchmarks/run_benchmark.py` — Throughput comparison: runs single-process and
  Spark (1/2/4 workers) on the same dataset, prints tx/sec + speedup table, saves
  `benchmark_results.csv`. Use `--mode all` for full comparison.
- `benchmarks/fault_tolerance_demo.py` — Two-scenario live demo:
  - Scenario 1 (single): crash after 10 tx, show 0 records written, restart from row 0
  - Scenario 2 (spark): kill one worker container, show Spark recovers from checkpoint
  - Prints side-by-side comparison table explaining why Spark recovers and single-process does not
- `benchmarks/BENCHMARK.md` — Methodology, expected outputs, interpretation guide.
  Now also covers the `listener_mp.py` offline ingestion benchmark — see
  the "Ingestion-layer benchmark" section.

### Alerting — ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Telegram bot was in the original spec but was scoped out.
- `alerting_group` consumer group exists in `consumer_groups.py` but
  nothing consumes it.

## ⚠️ Known issues / open TODOs

| # | Issue | File | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `get_recent_detections()` sorts by `detected_at` but Spark writes `processed_at` | `storage/mongo_store.py` | Change sort key to `processed_at` or `timestamp` |
| 2 | 2 malformed `tx_hash` rows in test CSV (91-char and 41-char) cause 35 Kafka → 33 MongoDB gap | `data/test_data_enriched.csv` | Fix or remove those 2 rows; add validation in `decode_flash_loan_udf` |
| 3 | Uniswap V3 flash() decode produces literal `"token0"`/`"token1"` — always LOW confidence | `processing/streaming_job.py` | Resolve real token addresses from contract or event logs |
| 4 | CoinGecko history API returns daily average price, not spot price at tx timestamp | `processing/streaming_job.py` | Upgrade to CoinGecko Pro range endpoint or Chainlink oracle |
| 5 | `cycle_path` field in API responses is always `[]` | `backend/Main.py`, frontend | Either remove the field or implement real cycle detection |
| 6 | `API_URL` in `HomePage.tsx` is hardcoded — breaks if backend port changes | `frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx` | Move to `VITE_API_URL` env var (already done in `decoderService.ts`) |
| 7 | SSE poll interval is 1 s in code; docs/reports say 3 s | `backend/Main.py` | Update docs or change `asyncio.sleep(1)` to match intent |
| 8 | 12 of the 35 "detected" rows in `data/test_data_enriched.csv` (the `0xab9c4b5d` / Aave V3 `flashLoan` rows, NOT `flashLoanSimple`) fail ABI decode with `InvalidPointer` against the real Aave V3 ABI — decode is enrichment-only so detection/Kafka produce still succeeds, but `assets=[...]` is replaced with `decode=FAILED(InvalidPointer)` in logs for these rows. The other 23 detected rows (2× `flashLoan`, 19× `flashLoanSimple`, 4× Uniswap `flash`) decode cleanly, which rules out an ABI/config problem — points to malformed/synthetic calldata for just those 12 rows | `data/test_data_enriched.csv` | Identify the 12 affected `tx_hash` values (selector `0xab9c4b5d`, decode=FAILED) and either fix their `input` field against real mainnet calldata or document them as intentionally-synthetic test rows |

**Watched contract addresses (WATCHLIST in `ingestion/config.py`):**
- `0x87870bca3f3fd6335c3f4ce8392d69350b4fa4e2` → Aave V3 Pool
- `0x8ad599c3a0ff1de082011efddc58f1908eb6e6d8` → Uniswap V3 USDC/WETH Pool
- `0xba12222222228d8ba445958a75a0704d566bf2c8` → Balancer V2 Vault

**Flash loan function selectors (SELECTORS in `ingestion/config.py`):**
- `0xab9c4b5d` → Aave V3 flashLoan
- `0x42b0b77c` → Aave V3 flashLoanSimple
- `0x5c38449e` → Balancer V2 flashLoan
- `0x490e6cbc` → Uniswap V3 flash

**Kafka:**
- Topic: `raw_txns` (4 partitions, replication 3, retention 1 hour)
  ⚠️ The README mentions `raw_transactions` in one place — that is wrong.
  The actual topic name used everywhere in code is **`raw_txns`**.
- Consumer groups: `flash_loan_detectors` (Spark), `alerting_group`
  (unused), `debug_consumer` (dev)
- Host bootstrap: `localhost:9094,localhost:9095,localhost:9096`
- Docker bootstrap: `kafka-1:9092,kafka-2:9092,kafka-3:9092`

**MongoDB Atlas:**
- DB: `flash_loan_detection` (env: `MONGODB_FLASHLOAN_NAME`)
- Collection: `transactions`
- Fields written by Spark: `tx_hash`, `protocol`, `from`, `pool`,
  `token`, `amount_human`, `amount_usd`, `confidence`, `timestamp`,
  `batch_id`, `processed_at`
- Fields expected by `mongo_store.py` indexes (NOT written by Spark):
  `block_number`, `detected_at`, `risk_level` — these indexes exist
  but are never populated by the streaming job.

**Redis:**
- Host: `localhost:6379` (from host) / `redis` (Docker)
- Password: `redis_dev_pass` (env: `REDIS_PASS`) — **required**
- Key pattern: `hist_price:{SYMBOL}:{DD-MM-YYYY}` (e.g. `hist_price:WETH:16-04-2026`)
- TTL: 86 400 s (1 day)
- Supported symbols for price lookup: WETH, WBTC (stablecoins return 1.0 directly)

**Confidence scoring (streaming_job.py):**
- HIGH   : amount_usd ≥ $1 000 000
- MEDIUM : amount_usd ≥ $100 000
- LOW    : amount_usd < $100 000 (or price unavailable)

## Kafka / Spark mental model (quick reference)

**Why 3 brokers + replication 3?** Every partition is stored on all 3
brokers (leader + 2 followers). If 1 broker dies, Kafka elects a new
leader — no data loss, no pipeline pause.

**Why 4 partitions + 4 Spark workers?** 1 Kafka partition = 1 Spark
task per micro-batch. With 4 partitions and 4 workers, every worker
processes exactly 1 partition in parallel. Scaling workers beyond 4
gives no additional parallelism on `raw_txns` without increasing partitions.

**Spark task assignment:** Spark Master re-assigns tasks every micro-batch;
a worker does not own a fixed partition. A crashed worker's task is picked
up by another worker from the last committed Kafka offset (checkpoint).

**Race condition fix:** `KAFKA_NUM_PARTITIONS: 4` in docker-compose ensures
any auto-created topic gets 4 partitions. Without this, if PySpark subscribes
before `ensure_topic()` runs, Kafka auto-creates at 1 partition and it cannot
be altered without deleting the topic.

---

## Multi-process mental model (listener_mp.py, quick reference)

**Why one feeder + N workers, not N independent subscriptions?** The
mempool subscription (live) or CSV read (offline) is cheap; the expensive
part is the per-item `get_transaction` RPC round-trip (live) or
filter+decode (offline). Duplicating the subscription would make every
worker see every item and redo the expensive part N times — strictly
worse. One feeder distributes items via a `multiprocessing.Queue`; N
workers each do their own expensive part in parallel.

**Why per-worker local counters instead of a shared `Manager().dict()`
with `+= 1`?** That pattern is read-RPC + increment + write-RPC across
process boundaries — NOT atomic. Confirmed empirically: 4 processes each
incrementing a shared counter 50 times (200 total) landed at 90–122,
i.e. 39–55% of increments silently lost. The fix used here: each worker
accumulates a plain local dict (zero IPC in the hot loop) and writes it
ONCE to a shared results map after draining its `_STOP` sentinel; the
parent sums per-worker dicts after `join()`. This is also strictly faster
(no per-item Manager round-trip).

**Why a `Barrier(n_workers + 1)`?** With zero per-item delay, a feeder can
enqueue + the OS can schedule faster than `mp.Process(start_method="spawn")`
workers finish spawning and connecting. Confirmed: without the barrier, 11
items split 9/2/0/0 across 4 workers (2 workers got nothing). The barrier
makes the feeder wait until every worker has signalled readiness before
the first item is enqueued. Work *distribution* after that point still
varies run-to-run (OS scheduling on `Queue.get()`) — only the *totals*
(`detected + filtered_out == rows`, `sum(worker_loads) == rows`) are
guaranteed deterministic.

**Why does more workers = slower in the offline benchmark?** Same root
cause as "Spark 1 worker slower than single-process" above: `mp.Process`
spawn cost (tens of ms per worker with `spawn`, since each re-imports the
module and rebuilds the Web3 ABI decoders) is fixed overhead per worker.
At 60 rows with sub-ms per-row work, N workers pay N× that overhead to
parallelize <0.5s of total work. This inverts once per-item cost is large
relative to spawn cost — i.e. real RPC fetches (50–200ms each), which
`--rpc-delay` simulates in live mode.

## Detection architecture (actual, not spec)

The spec PDF describes graph construction + DFS cycle detection. **That
design was not implemented.** The actual detection logic in
`streaming_job.py` works as follows:

```
Raw calldata
    ↓
decode_flash_loan_udf   (parse ABI-encoded assets + amounts from input hex)
    ↓
symbol_udf + human_amount_udf   (address → symbol, uint256 → human float)
    ↓
price_udf   (Redis hist cache → CoinGecko daily average → static fallback)
    ↓
amount_usd = primary_amount_human × price_usd
    ↓
confidence_udf   (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW by USD threshold)
    ↓
foreachPartition → MongoDB Atlas bulk upsert
```

There is no cycle path, no graph, no arbitrage profit estimation, and
no price-deviation scoring. The `cycle_path` field returned by the API
is always `[]`.
